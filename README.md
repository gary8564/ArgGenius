# ArgGenius

This repository focuses on experimenting the capacity of large language models (LLMs) in argumentation generation. To undergo more detailed analysis, this app was built to hold a small competition between human and LLM. More specifically, the app will generate two counterarguments based on the topic and stance the users select: one is from LLM, the other is from human and ask users to choose one counterargument against their stance that they feel more convinced. 

In this project, [Falcon-7b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct) and [Gorilla](https://shishirpatil.github.io/gorilla/) from Huggingface Hub was used.


## Requirements

- [Python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [LangChain library](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html)
- [Huggingface API key](https://huggingface.co/login?next=%2Fsettings%2Ftokens)


## Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daveebbelaar/langchain-experiments.git
```

#### 2. Create a Python environment

Python 3.6 or higher using `venv` or `conda`. 

Using `venv`:

``` bash
cd ArgGenius
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Using `conda`:
``` bash
cd ArgGenius
conda create -n langchain-env python=3.8
conda activate langchain-env
```

#### 3. Install the required dependencies
``` bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Set up the keys in a .env file

First, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Inside the file, add your Huggingface API key:

```makefile
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="your_api_key_here"
```

Save the file and close it. In your Python script or Jupyter notebook, load the `.env` file using the following code:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
```

When needed, you can access the `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN ` as an environment variable:
```python
import os
api_key = os.environ['HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN']
```

## Usage
Run locally on your local machine.
``` bash
streamlit run app.py
```


## Data corpus

The arguments generated by human in the app is provided by [The Dagstuhl-15512 ArgQuality Corpus](http://argumentation.bplaced.net/arguana/data)
